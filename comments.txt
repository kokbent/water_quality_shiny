- There are data for Site = 0. What would they mean?
- Sensorplot: the ggplot before if (input$site2 == 0) statement is "not in used"
- With or without the if (input$site2 == 0) statement, the plot would be the same.
- Question here is what do we want when one of the sites are 0, and when both of the sites are 0 (or identical).
- Unique and sort the site/comparison
- Does the "site1" always go on top and "site2" always below? Right now it doesn't
- Checkbox button for discrete data?
- Labelling of discrete data
- Stacking of Lakewatch vs YSI plot?
