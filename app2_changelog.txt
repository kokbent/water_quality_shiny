Changelog:

1. Input & Output flow:
Can use output$sensorplot <- renderPlot({...}) instead of having to go through reactive first.

2. Using lubridate function to standardize both wq and lab date format (POSIXct)
3. This allows us to stack data from wq and lab in one plot. User can toggle whether to overlay 
  point sample data onto the continuous data plot.
4. Experimenting with lineplot for continuous data plot.
5. In doing so, we need to create table of NAs so that ggplot knows not to connect the dots where
  there are missing data between them.
6. Let user toggle between viewing hourly data or daily mean.
7. To plot daily mean instead of hourly data, the date time format actually changes from POSIXct
  to Date. This can cause some problem later in ggplot. May need revision of code.
8. Changed the width of sidebar and main panel. Also increase the height of plots to 600px
9. Increased base_size of the theme so that font is bigger.
10. Standardizing the look of sensorplot and labplot so that they align properly.
11. Stacking Sensor_Type in one plot (instead of faceting).
12. Let ggplot decide itself the breaks of x axis, for now...
